# Introduction

This exercise focuses on predicting diabetes using a dataset provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set). The main goal is to determine whether a patient has diabetes based on various diagnostic features. The dataset contains information about female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old and includes an additional variable indicating the different zones of the patients, ranging from 'zona1' to 'zona30'.

<div style="float: right; margin-right: 20px; width: 50%;">
  ```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
  knitr::include_graphics('diabetes.png')
  ```
</div>


The dataset includes a range of medical measurements that are useful in predicting the likelihood of diabetes. These features are:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of times a patient has been pregnant.
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose tolerance test.
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin levels (mu U/ml).
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function, representing the patient's hereditary risk.
- **Age**: The patient's age (in years).
- **Zone**: The newly added variable indicating the patient's zone, ranging from 'zona1' to 'zona30'.
- **Outcome**: A binary indicator representing whether the patient has been diagnosed with diabetes (0 or 1).

Explore the relationships between these features using `jags` or `brms` and use them to build a predictive model that can accurately classify patients as having diabetes or not. Understanding these relationships will also provide insights into the contributing factors for diabetes among the Pima Indian female population.
